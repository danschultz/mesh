	/**
	 * The <code>Commits</code> class is responsible for keeping a linear history of each commit 
	 * that the data store has requested. The class also manages the queueing of commits, and 
	 * rolling back the store if a commit fails.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * When the store requests its changes to be committed, a <code>Commit</code> object is created 
	 * that contains a snapshot of each dirty entity, and is put into a commit queue. Only a single 
	 * commit can be persisted at a time. After each successful commit, the next commit is executed 
	 * until the queue is empty.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * If a commit fails to persist, the queue is halted until a rollback is performed. It's the
	 * responsibility of the application to listen for a failed commit and execute the rollback. If
	 * a rollback is performed, the store is put back into the state of the last successful commit.
	 * </p>
