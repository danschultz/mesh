	/**
	 * A base class for an operation that contains a set of other operations to
	 * execute. There are two types of compound operations: parallel and chained.
	 * A parallel operation will execute its operations together, where as, a
	 * chained operation will execute each of its operations one at a time, in a 
	 * sequence.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * This class only allows the adding and removing of operations when the this 
	 * operation is not executing.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * If an operation belonging to this operation fails, this operation will cancel
	 * all remaining operations and dispatch an unsuccessful
	 * <code>FinishedOperationEvent.FINISHED</code> event. Clients that need to respond
	 * to the operation's fault, should add fault listeners to the individual commands.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Clients shouldn't need to work with this class directly. All operations have
	 * a <code>Operation.during()</code> and <code>Operation.then()</code> methods
	 * that can be used for combining operations.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @see operations.Operation#during()
	 * @see operations.Operation#then()
